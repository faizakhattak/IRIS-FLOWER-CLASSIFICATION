# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
Project Summary:
This project aimed to build and evaluate a machine learning model for classifying Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Main Objective:
Develop a classification model to accurately predict the species of an Iris flower given its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Dataset:
The Iris flower dataset, a well-known benchmark dataset containing 150 samples from three Iris species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica). Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The dataset was loaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Model Evaluation:
A Random Forest Classifier was trained on the dataset after splitting it into training and testing sets.
Model performance was evaluated on the unseen test set using accuracy score and classification report.

Model Performance:
The model achieved a high overall accuracy of 93.33%.
The classification report indicated good precision, recall, and f1-score for all three Iris species, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between them.

Conclusion:
The project successfully built and evaluated a Random Forest Classifier that can accurately classify Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The model achieved good performance, suggesting its potential for real-world applications involving Iris flower identification.
